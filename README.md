# argocd_apps
This repo contains application config for argocd.

# Application:

An application is a declarative representation of a set of Kubernetes resources (e.g., deployments, services, config maps) and their desired state, managed and synchronized by ArgoCD for continuous delivery.

# AppofApplications:

An AppOfApps or "Application of Applications" is a pattern where a single ArgoCD application manages the deployment and configuration of multiple child applications, allowing for centralized management and coordination of complex application architectures.

# Helm:

 ArgoCD can deploy and manage applications that are packaged as Helm charts.
